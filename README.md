# Resource-Delivery-Systemüöë
This project implements a graph-based resource delivery system to determine the most efficient warehouse for delivering medical resources to hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program simulates a network of hospitals and warehouses, with roads connecting them, each assigned a random traffic level. Using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, the system identifies the fastest route from a warehouse to a specified hospital based on traffic levels.

# Features üöÄ
 1.Shortest Path Calculation: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest route between a warehouse and a hospital.
 
 2.Traffic Simulation: Simulates random traffic levels on the roads to enhance realism.
 
 3.Hospital and Warehouse Data: Includes predefined data of hospitals and warehouses for demonstration.
 
 4.Efficient Resource Allocation: Identifies the warehouse with the shortest delivery time to the hospital in need.

 #   Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
  C++: The programming language used to build the project.
  
   Windows API: Used for colored console output.

 # Prerequisites
 *C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC, or Clang)
 
 *A Windows system for the console coloring feature (optional)
